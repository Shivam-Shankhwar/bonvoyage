                  BonVoyage is a all-in-one stop that compares accommodation
                  prices and offers provided to us by many different booking
                  sites
                </span>
                globally, including online travel agencies (OTAs), accommodation
                chains and independent hotels. This means that while users
                decide on BonVoyage which hotel best suits their needs, the
                booking process itself is completed through the booking sites,
                which are linked to our website.

                  Meanwhile, a booking site or Online Travel Agency (OTA) is a
